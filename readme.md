 For this game, it's a Doom / Wolfenstein fan game, with the old systeme of raycasting for pseudo 3D.
 The creation of content and the creation of the systeme, I have make this with the tuto of  **Coder Space** in YouTube, with this video : **[Creating a DOOM (Wolfenstein) - style 3D Game in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ)**.
